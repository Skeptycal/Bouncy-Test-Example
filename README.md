This is an application that is uploaded with the purpose of showing tesing using OCUnit. The application itself creates many shapes that move around on the scren, but the testing makes sure that the shapes do not have a negative width or height. Further testing could be made to make sure that the amount of shapes on the screen do not exceed a predetermined amount (In this case 10).
